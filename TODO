TODO for FAI-Updater - 01/24/2020
---------------------------------

- highlight complete column when selecting it with arrow-keys
  ->this is a terminal-issue: with xterm it works, with rxvt not

- causes perl string-exception on pressing "Return" in empty
  column->FIXED
  - this exception may also occur during normal operation
    sometimes

- build debian-package for convient installation

- add possiblity to trigger sorting of hosts in
  all lists (not just waiting queue)
