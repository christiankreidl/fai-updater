TODO for FAI-Updater - 02/19/2007
---------------------------------

- ask for additional confirmation on pressing "q" for exit
  (Updater quits on typing "q" now, letting all pending
   task finish though)->FIXED

- highlight complete column when selecting it with arrow-keys
  - the original version did this, but the feature got lost somehow ?!?!

- getopts can be confused easily:

	"updater-curses -nonsense" will fail
	but "updater-curses -nonsense blablubb" not

  ->FIXED (getopts still annoys with its warnings though)

- causes perl string-exception on pressing "Return" in empty
  column->FIXED
  - this exception may also occur during normal operation
    sometimes

- build debian-package for convient installation
