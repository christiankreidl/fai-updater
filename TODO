TODO for FAI-Updater - 02/19/2007
---------------------------------

- ask for additional confirmation on pressing "q" for exit
  (Updater quits on typing "q" now, letting all pending
   task finish though)

- causes perl string-exception on pressing "Return" in empty
  column; this exception may also occur during normal operation
  sometimes
