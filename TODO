TODO for FAI-Updater - 02/19/2007
---------------------------------

- ask for additional confirmation on pressing "q" for exit
  (Updater quits on typing "q" now, letting all pending
   task finish though)->FIXED

- highlight complete column when selecting it with arrow-keys
  ->this is a terminal-issue: with xterm it works, with rxvt not

- causes perl string-exception on pressing "Return" in empty
  column->FIXED
  - this exception may also occur during normal operation
    sometimes

- build debian-package for convient installation

- fai-updater can be confused when a host is specified
  on the hostlist twice which can happen when it
  belongs to two individual netgroups. it will
  run "fai softupdate" twice and merge the log
  files while the update will naturally abort on
  one machine since another instance of fai
  is already running (/var/run/fai/fai_softupdate_is_running
  exists)

- add possiblity to trigger sorting of hosts in
  all lists (not just waiting queue)
