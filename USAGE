To be able to connect to the clients, you need to have some way to access 
them via ssh as root without entering a password.
A solution for this is to install a matching file as 
/root/.ssh/authorized_keys, start ssh-agent and load the private key 
into it _before_ starting fai-updater.
Another, but from a security point of view dangerous, possibility is to
use a passphrase-less ssh private key into the account under which you run 
fai-updater.
